Spoofy is a small web app that allows you to test a domain's MX, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records. Based on the results, you can see if your domain is properly configured or potentially vulnerable to spoofing.

## Features

-   üìß Check MX, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records
-   üîí Check the SSL status of the domain
-   üîç View detailed information about each record
-   üìã Get an overview of the records' status
-   üõ°Ô∏è Get recommendations for each record

## Get started

Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/dikayx/spoofy/releases) and use the [setup.sh](setup.sh) (Mac & Linux) or [setup.bat](setup.bat) (Windows) script to set up the app via Docker or locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dikayx/spoofy.git && cd spoofy && chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh
```

On Windows, open a command prompt (cmd) and run:
